# Genetic Treasures

This python program uses genetic algorithm to evolve an instruction set for a virtual machine that
executes them and creates a set of movement instructions for a guy that collects treasures on a
map. Get it? Again. We use genetic algorithm to generate a set of instructions – 64 bytes. A virtual machine takes these instructions and generates a set of movements – up, right, down, left. Then there's a map with treasures and a guy that wants them. He takes the generated set of movements and collects the treasures. The number of treasures collected is the fitness function.
